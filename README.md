Work in progress will update !

Together the team Michael Pajewski (mtp9k) and Buckley Dowdle (bdowdle) developed multiclass model built by ensemble 9 CatBoost models with the goal to predict the operating condition of water access points for the Tanzanian Ministry of Water.  The teams project submission was ranked in top 5% in terms of classification rate accuracy and only 1% less accruate than 1st place submission for the competition at time of submission. 

The project is broken into two files the data cleaning file data_cleaning.ipynb and the CatBoost model file catboost_model.ipynb
